This is a list of platforms GNU Radius is known to compile and run on.
If you compile it on a platform not listed here, please drop me a note.    

Intel x86
    i386-pc-linux-gnu
    i686-pc-linux-gnu
    i386-unknown-freebsd4.4
    i386-pc-solaris2.7
    i386-unknown-gnu0.2

AMD    
    x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
    
Alpha
    alpha-unknown-freebsd4.4

        There is a bug in GCC 2.95.3 for this platform, which is triggered
        by -O2 option to the compiler. To avoid the bug, set the CFLAGS
        variable before running configure, e.g.:

             CFLAGS=-g ./configure

        GCC issues the warning:

             warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size

        when compiling the following source files: radlib/rx.h, radlib/rx.c,
        radiusd/rewrite.y, radiusd/checkrad.c
        It can safely be ignored.

Sparc
    sparc-sun-solaris2.8   (SunOS 5.8 Generic sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10)

AIX (4.3.3)
    Radius 0.95 works. Radius 0.96 was not checked.
