12.2.4.3 Dereferencing Variables
................................

"Dereferencing" a variable means accessing its value.  The simplest form
of dereferencing is by prepending a dollar sign to the variable name:

     foo = 1
     print foo => foo
     print $foo => 1

Notice, that in the example above, the first 'print' statement
understands 'foo' as a literal string, whereas the second one prints the
value of the variable.

   Dereferencing an undefined variable produces error message:

     print $x error-> variable `x' used before definition

   Optionally, the variable name may be surrounded by curly braces.
Both '$foo' and '${foo}' are equivalent.  The use of the latter form is
obligatory only when the variable name coincides with one of the
reserved keywords (*note Reserved Keywords::).  It also can be used to
resolve ambiguity between using dash as a part of user name and as a
subtraction operator:

     long-name = 2
     $long-name => 2
     $long-name-1 error-> variable `long-name-1' used before definition
     ${long-name}-1 => 1
     $long-name - 1 => 1

   We recommend to always surround '-' with whitespace when it is used
as arithmetic operator.

   The '${}' notation also permits some operations similar to shell
variable substitution.

${variable:-text}
     Use default values.  If VARIABLE is unset, return TEXT, otherwise
     return the value of the VARIABLE.

          $x error-> variable `x' used before definition
          ${x:-1} => 1
          x = 2
          ${x:-1} => 2

${variable:=text}
     Assign default values.  If VARIABLE is unset, TEXT is assigned to
     it.  The expression always returns the value of the variable.

          $x error-> variable `x' used before definition
          ${x:=1} => 1
          $x => 1

${variable:?text}
     Display error if unset.  If VARIABLE is unset, TEXT is written to
     the standard error (if TEXT is empty, the default diagnostic
     message is used) and further execution of the program is aborted.
     Otherwise, the value of VARIABLE is returned.

          $x error-> variable `x' used before definition
          ${x:?} error-> x: variable unset
          ${x:?foobar} error-> foobar

${variable::text}
     Prompt for the value if unset.  If VARIABLE is unset, 'radtest'
     prints TEXT (or a default message, if it is empty), reads the
     standard input up to the newline character and returns the value
     read.  Otherwise, the value of the variable is returned.  This
     notation provides a convenient way for asking user to supply
     default values.

          ${x::} -| (<teletype>:1)x?
          ${x::Enter value of x: } -| Enter value of x:

${variable:&text}
     Prompt for the value with echo turned off if unset.  This is
     similar to the '${variable::text}', with the exception that the
     input value will not be echoed on the screen.  This notation
     provides a convenient way for asking user to supply default values
     for variables (such as passwords, shared secrets, etc.)  while
     preventing them from being compromised.

12.2.4.4 Accessing Elements of A/V Pair Lists
.............................................

Elements of an 'avlist' are accessed as if it were an array, i.e.:

     $VARIABLE [ ATTRIBUTE-NAME ]

   If the attribute ATTRIBUTE-NAME is of 'string' data type and VARIABLE
may contain more than one pair with this attribute, adding an asterisk
after ATTRIBUTE-NAME returns concatenated values of all such pairs:

     $VARIABLE [ ATTRIBUTE-NAME * ]

   Examples:

     x = (NAS-Port-Id = 127.0.0.1 \
          Reply-Message = "a long"
          Reply-Message = " string"

     $x[NAS-Port-Id] => 127.0.0.1
     $x[Reply-Message] => "a long"
     $x[Reply-Message*] => "a long string"


File: radius.info,  Node: Assignment Options,  Next: Built-in Variables,  Prev: Accessing Elements of A/V Pair Lists,  Up: Variables in radtest

12.2.4.5 Assignment Options
...........................

You can set any 'radtest' variable from the command line.  There are two
ways of doing so.

   First, you can use "variable assignment option" '--assign' (or '-a').
Its syntax is:

     --assign VARIABLE=TEXT
     -a VARIABLE=TEXT

For example:

     radtest -a foobar=5

   Another way is useful when you load a 'radtest' program by '--file'
or '-f'.  This second way consists in including a variable assignment in
the form

     VARIABLE=TEXT

in the command line after the script name.  For example:

     radtest -f myprog.rad foo=5 addr=127.0.0.1

This method is especially useful for executable scripts that are run
using '#!' shell magic.  Consider a simple script:

     #! /usr/local/bin/radtest -f
     print $addr

The value of ADDR can be given to the script from the command line as in
the example below:

     myprog.rad addr=127.0.0.1


File: radius.info,  Node: Built-in Variables,  Prev: Assignment Options,  Up: Variables in radtest

12.2.4.6 Built-in Variables
...........................

The following variables are predefined:

_
     (an underscore character)

     Contains the result of last evaluated expression.

REPLY_CODE
     Contains the last reply code received from the RADIUS server
     ('integer').

REPLY
     Contains the A/V pairs lastly received from the RADIUS server
     ('avlist').

SOURCEIP
     Contains the source IP address of the RADIUS client ('ipaddr').  By
     default, it equals the IP address set via 'source_ip' statement in
     your 'client.conf' file (*note clientconf::).

INPUT
     The value of the input read by 'input' statement (*note input:
     Built-in Primitives.).

OPTVAR
     The option obtained by the recent call to 'getopt' (*note getopt:
     Built-in Primitives.).

OPTARG
     Argument to the option obtained by the recent call to 'getopt'.

OPTIND
     Index of the next command line argument to be processed by
     'getopt'.  If the last call to 'getopt' returned false, 'OPTIND'
     contains index of the first non-optional argument in the command
     line.


File: radius.info,  Node: Positional Parameters,  Next: Expressions in radtest,  Prev: Variables in radtest,  Up: radtest

12.2.5 Positional Parameters
----------------------------

Normally 'radtest' stops parsing its command line when it encounters
either first non-optional argument (i.e.  the one not starting with
dash), or an argument consisting of two dashes.  The rest of the command
line starting from the first non-optional argument forms "positional
parameters".  These parameters are said to form the "top-level
environment".

   Similarly, when invoking a user-defined function (*note Function
Definitions::), arguments passed to it are said to form the "current
environment" of the function.  These arguments are positional parameters
for this function.

   Positional parameters are assigned numbers starting from 1.  To
access ("dereference") a positional parameter, the syntax '$N' is used,
where N is the number of the parameter.  Alternative forms, such as
'${N}' or '${N:-text}', can also be used.  These work exactly as
described in *note Dereferencing Variables::).

   The number of positional parameters can be accessed using a special
notation '$#'.

   Several things need to be mentioned:

   * All top-level positional parameters have 'string' data type,
     whereas the types of positional parameters in a function current
     environment are determined before invoking the function.

   * Special notion '$0' returns the name of the function being
     evaluated.  When used in the top-level environment, it returns the
     name of 'radtest' program as given by '--file' ('-f') option.

   * Dereferencing non-existing parameter returns empty string.  This
     differs from dereferencing non-existing variable, which results in
     error.

   * 'AWK' programmers should note that assignments (*note Assignment
     Options::) are not included in the top level environment (see
     example below).

   For example, suppose you run:

     radtest -f script.rad name foo=bar 5

   Then, the top-level environment of program 'script.rad' consists of
the following variables:

     $0 => script.rad
     $1 => name
     $2 => 5

12.2.6 Expressions
------------------

An "expression" evaluates to a value, which can be printed, assigned to
a variable, used in a conditional statement or passed to a function.  As
in other languages, expressions in 'radtest' include literals, variable
and positional parameter dereferences, function calls and combinations
of these with various operators.

12.2.6.1 Arithmetic Operations
..............................

'Radtest' provides the common arithmetic operators, which follow normal
precedence rules (*note Precedence::), and work as you would expect them
to.  The only notable exception is subtraction operator (minus) which
can be used as part of a variable or attribute name, and therefore
expressions like '$x-3' are ambiguous.  This expression can be thought
of either as a dereference of the variable 'x-3' (*note Dereferencing
Variables::), or as subtraction of the value '3' from the value of the
variable 'x'.  'Radtest' always resolves this ambiguity in the favor of
variable dereference.  Therefore we advise you to always surround minus
sign by whitespace, if it is used as a subtraction operator.  So,
instead of '$x-3', write '$x - 3'.  For other methods of solving this
ambiguity, *Note minus-ambiguity::.

   This table lists the arithmetic operators in order from highest
precedence to lowest:

'- X'
     Negation.

'+ X'
     Unary plus.  This is equivalent to 'X'.

'X * Y'
     Multiplication.

'X / Y'
     Division.

'X % Y'
     Remainder.

'X + Y'
     Addition.

'X - Y'
     Subtraction.

   Unary plus and minus have the same precedence, the multiplication,
division and remainder all have the same precedence, and addition and
subtraction have the same precedence.

   If X and Y are of different data types, their values are first
coerced to a common data type, selected using a set of rules (*note
Conversion Between Data Types::).

12.2.6.2 String Operations
..........................

There is only one string operation: concatenation.  It is represented by
plus sign, e.g.:

     "string" + "ent" => "stringent"


File: radius.info,  Node: A/V List Ops,  Next: Comparison Ops,  Prev: String Ops,  Up: Expressions in radtest

12.2.6.3 Operations on A/V Lists
................................

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

   The following operations are defined on A/V lists:

'X + Y'
     "Addition".  The A/V pairs from Y are added to X, honoring the
     respective pairs additivity (*note additivity: Attributes.).  For
     example:

          ( User-Name = "foo" ) + ( Password = "bar" )
          => ( User-Name = "foo" Password = "bar" )

          ( User-Name = "foo" Service-Type = Login-User ) + \
           ( Service-Type = Framed-User Password = "bar" )
          => ( User-Name = "foo" \
                    Service-Type = Framed-User \
                    Password = "bar" )

'X - Y'
     "Subtraction".  The result of this operation is an A/V list
     consisting of pairs from X, which are not found in Y.

          ( User-Name = "foo" Service-Type = Login-User ) - \
          ( Service-Type = Framed-User )
          => ( User-Name = "foo" )

     Notice, that only attribute name matters, its value is ignored.

'X % Y'
     "Intersection".  The result of this operation is an A/V pair list
     consisting of pairs from X which are also present in Y.

          ( User-Name = "foo" Service-Type = Login-User ) - \
          ( Service-Type = Framed-User )
          => ( Service-Type = Login-User )


File: radius.info,  Node: Comparison Ops,  Next: Boolean Ops,  Prev: A/V List Ops,  Up: Expressions in radtest

12.2.6.4 Comparison Operations
..............................

"Comparison expressions" compare operands for relationships such as
equality.  They return boolean values, i.e.  'true' or 'false'.  The
comparison operations are nonassociative, i.e.  they cannot be used
together as in:

     # _Wrong!_
     1 < $x < 2

   Use boolean operations (*note Boolean Ops::) to group comparisons
together.

   Comparison operations can only be used in conditional expressions.

   This table lists all comparison operators in order from highest
precedence to lowest (notice, however, the comment after it):

'X = Y'
     True if X is equal to Y.  'C' and 'AWK' programmers, please note
     _single_ equal sign!

'X != Y'
     True if X is not equal to Y.

'X < Y'
     True if X is less than Y.

'X <= Y'
     True if X is less than or equal to Y.

'X > Y'
     True if X is greater than Y.

'X >= Y'
     True if X is greater than or equal to Y.

   Operators '=' and '!=' have equal precedence.  Operators '<', '<=',
'>', '>=' have equal precedence.

   Most operators are defined for all 'radtest' data types.  However,
only '=' and '!=' are defined for 'avlist's.  Using any other comparison
operator with 'avlist's produces error.

   If X and Y are of different data types, their values are first
coerced to a common data type, selected using a set of rules (*note
Conversion Between Data Types::).

12.2.6.5 Boolean Operations
...........................

A "boolean operation" is a combination of comparison expressions.
Boolean operations can only be used in conditional expressions.

   This table lists all comparison operators in order from highest
precedence to lowest.

'not X'
'! X'
     True if X is false.

'X and Y'
     True if both X and Y are true.  The subexpression Y is evaluated
     only if X is true.

'X or Y'
     True if at least one of X or Y is true.  The subexpression Y is
     evaluated only if X is false.

12.2.6.6 Conversion Between Data Types
......................................

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

   The unary negation operand is always converted to 'integer' type:

     -(1 + 1)  => -2
     -(127.0.0.1 + 2) => -2130706435
     - ("1" + "1") => -11
     - "text" error-> cannot convert string to integer

The unary 'not' operand is converted using the following rules:

  1. If the operand is 'integer', no conversion is performed.
  2. If the operand is 'STRNUM' (*note STRNUM::) or 'ipaddr', it is
     converted to integer.
  3. If the operand is 'string' (but is not 'STRNUM'), the result of
     'not' is 'true' only if the operand is an empty string.
  4. If the operand is 'avl', the result of 'not' is 'true' if the list
     is empty.

   Examples:

     not 0 => 1
     not 10 => 0
     not "23" => 0
     not "0" => 1
     not "text" => 0
     not "" => 1
     not 127.0.0.1 => 0
     not 0.0.0.0 => 1

   When operands of two different data types are used in a binary
operation, one of the operands is converted ("cast") to another
operand's type according to the following rules:

  1. If one of the operands is literal, 'radtest' attempts to convert
     another operand to the literal data type.  If this attempt fails,
     it goes on to rule 2.
  2. If one of operands is 'STRNUM' (*note STRNUM::) and another is of
     numeric data type (i.e.  either 'integer' or 'ipaddr'), the latter
     is converted to string representation.
  3. If one of the operands is 'ipaddr' and another is 'integer', the
     latter is converted to 'ipaddr'.
  4. Otherwise, if one of the operands is string, the second operand is
     also converted to string.
  5. Otherwise, the two operands are incompatible.  'Radtest' prints
     appropriate diagnostics and aborts execution of the current
     statement.

12.2.6.7 Function Calls
.......................

A "function" is a name for a particular sequence of statements.  It is
defined using special definition syntax (*note Function Definitions::).
Normally a function return some value.  The way to use this value in an
expression is with a "function call" expression, which consists of the
function name followed by a comma-separated list of "arguments" in
parentheses.  The arguments are expressions which provide values for the
function call environment (*note Positional Parameters::.  When there is
more than one argument, they are separated by commas.  If there are no
arguments, write just '()' after the function name.  Here are some
examples:

     foo()             no arguments
     bar(1)            one argument
     bar(1, "string")  two arguments


File: radius.info,  Node: Precedence,  Prev: Function Calls,  Up: Expressions in radtest

12.2.6.8 Operator Precedence (How Operators Nest)
.................................................

"Operator precedence" determines the order of executing operators, when
different operators appear close by in one expression.  For example, '*'
has higher precedence than '+'; thus, 'a + b * c' means to multiply 'b'
and 'c', and then add 'a' to the product.

   You can overrule the precedence of the operators by using
parentheses.  You can think of the precedence rules as saying where the
parentheses are assumed to be if you do not write parentheses yourself.
Thus the above example is equivalent to 'a + (b * c)'.

   When operators of equal precedence are used together, the leftmost
operator groups first.  Thus, 'a - b + c' groups as '(a - b) + c'.

   This table lists 'radtest' operators in order from highest precedence
to the lowest:

'$'
     Dereference.

'(...)'
     Grouping.

'+ - not !'
     Unary plus, minus.  Unary boolean negation.

'* / %'
     Multiplication, division, modulus.

'+ -'
     Addition, subtraction.

'< <= = != > >='
     Relational operators.

'and'
     Logical 'and'.

'or'
     Logical 'or'.

12.2.7 Function Definitions
---------------------------

A "function" is a name for a particular sequence of statements.  The
syntax for the function definition is:

     NAME
     begin
       ...
     end

where NAME is function name and '...' represent a non-empty list of
valid 'radtest' statements.

   Notice that newline characters are obligatory after NAME, 'begin' and
before the final 'end' keyword.

   If the function accepts arguments, these can be referenced in the
function body using '$N' notation (*note Positional Parameters::).  To
return the value from the function 'return' statement is used.

   For example, here is a function that computes sum of the squares of
its two arguments:

     hypo
     begin
             return $1*$1 + $2*$2
     end

12.2.8 Interacting with Radius Servers
--------------------------------------

'Radtest' provides two commands for interaction with remote RADIUS
servers.

   Command 'send' sends request to the server specified in
'raddb/client.conf'.  Its syntax is:

     send [FLAGS] PORT-TYPE CODE [EXPR-OR-PAIR-LIST]

   Optional FLAGS can be used for fine-tuning the internals of 'send'.
You will seldom need to use these, unless you are developing GNU Radius.
*Note send: Built-in Primitives, for the detailed description of these.

   The first obligatory argument, PORT-TYPE, specifies which RADIUS port
to send the request to.  Specifying 'auth' will send the request to the
authentication port (*note auth-port: clientconf.); specifying 'acct'
will send it to the accounting port (*note acct-port: clientconf.).

   Argument CODE gives the request code.  It is either a number or a
symbolic request code name (*note Numeric Values::).

   The last argument, EXPR-OR-PAIR-LIST is either a 'radtest' expression
evaluating to 'avlist' or a list of A/V pairs.  These pairs will be
included in the request.

   Here are several examples:

     # Send a Status-Server request without attributes.
     send auth Status-Server

     # Send an Access-Request with two attributes
     send auth Access-Request User-Name = "foo" User-Password = "bar"

     # Send an Accounting-Request, taking attributes from the variable
     # ATTR
     send acct Accounting-Request $attr

   Command 'send' stores the reply code into the variable 'REPLY_CODE'
and reply pairs into the variable 'REPLY' (*note Built-in Variables::).

   Another primitive is 'expect'.  'Expect' takes at most two arguments:
a request code (either numeric or symbolic, (*note Numeric Values::))
and optional list of A/V pairs (similar to 'send' EXPR-OR-PAIR-LIST
argument).  'Expect' check if these match current 'REPLY_CODE' and
'REPLY' values and if so, prints the string 'PASS'.  Otherwise, it
prints 'FAIL'.  This command is designed primarily for use in GNU Radius
testsuite.

   'Expect' is usually used right after 'send', as shown in the example
below:

     send auth Access-Request User-Name = "foo" User-Password = "bar"
     expect Access-Accept Reply-Message = "Access allowed"

12.2.9 Conditional Statements
-----------------------------

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

   'Radtest' provides two kinds of conditional statements: 'if' and
'case'.

If statement
------------

An 'if' statement in its simplest form is:

     if COND STMT

where COND is a conditional expression and STMT is a valid 'radtest'
statement.  Optional newline may be inserted between COND STMT.

   In this form, 'if' evaluates the condition and if it yields true,
executes the statement.  For example:

     if $REPLY[NAS-IP-Address] = 127.0.0.1
        print "Request from localhost"

   More complex form of this statement allows to select between the two
statements:

     if COND STMT-1 else STMT-2

Here, STMT-1 will be executed if COND evaluates to true, and STMT-2 will
be executed if COND evaluates to false.

   Notice, that an optional newline is allowed between COND and STMT-1
and right after 'else' keyword.  However, a newline before 'else'
constitutes an error.

   If several statements should be executed in a branch of the 'if'
statement, use compound statement as in the example below:

     if $REPLY_CODE != Accounting-Response
     begin
       print "Accounting failed.\n"
       exit 1
     end else
       print "Accounting succeeded.\n"

   'If' statements can be nested to any depth.

Case statement
--------------

'Case' statement allows select a statement based on whether a 'string'
expression matches given regular expression.  The syntax of 'case'
statement is:

     case EXPR in
     EXPR-1 ) STMT-1
     EXPR-2 ) STMT-2
     ...
     EXPR-N ) STMT-N
     end

where EXPR is a control expression, EXPR-1, EXPR-2 etc.  are expressions
evaluating to _extended_ POSIX regular expressions (for the detailed
description of these *note Regular Expression Library: (regex)Top.).

   'Case' statement first evaluates EXPR and converts it to 'string'
data type.  Then it evaluates each EXPR-N in turn and tests if the
resulting regular expression matches EXPR.  If so, the statement STMT-N
is executed and the execution of 'case' statement finishes.

   The following example illustrates the concept:

     case $COMMAND in
     "auth.*")       authenticate($LIST, no)
     "acct")         authenticate($LIST, yes)
     ".*")           begin
                       print "Unknown command."
                       exit 1
                     end
     end

   'Bourne shell' programmers should notice that:

   * 'Case' statement ends with 'end', not 'esac'.
   * There is no need to put ';;' at the end of each branch,
   * Boolean operations are not allowed in EXPR-N.

12.2.10 Loops
-------------

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

   Two looping constructs are provided: 'while' and 'do...while'.

While loop
----------

The syntax of a while loop is:

     while COND
       STMT

   Newline after COND is obligatory.

Do...while loop
---------------

     do
       STMT
     while COND

   As usual 'do...while' loop differs from its 'while' counterpart in
that its STMT is executed at least once.

   The looping constructs can be nested to any depth.

   Two special statements are provided for branching within loop
constructs.  These are 'break' and 'continue'.

   'Break' statement stops the execution of the current loop statement
and passes control to the statement immediately following it

     while $x < 10
     begin
       if $x < $y
          break
       ...
       x = $x + 1
     end
     print "OK\n"

In the example above, execution of 'break' statement passes control to
'print' statement.

   'Break' may also take an argument: a literal number representing the
number of nested loop statements to break from.  For example, the
'break' statement in the sample code below will exit from the outermost
'while':

     while $y < 10
     begin
       while $x < 10
       begin
         if $x < $y
            break 2
         ...
         x = $x + 1
       end
       ...
       y = $y + 1
     end
     print "OK\n"

   'Continue' statement passes control to the condition of the current
looping construct.  When used with a numeric argument, the latter
specifies the number of the nesting looping construct to pass control to
(as with 'break', the innermost loop is considered to have number 1, so
'continue' is equivalent to 'continue 1').


File: radius.info,  Node: Built-in Primitives,  Next: Sample Radtest Program,  Prev: Loops,  Up: radtest

12.2.11 Built-in Primitives
---------------------------

 -- Radtest built-in: getopt OPTSTRING [OPT [ARG [IND]]]
     'Getopt' is used to break up command line options for subsequent
     parsing.

     The only mandatory argument, OPTSTRING is a list of short
     (one-character) options to be recognized.  Each short option
     character in OPTSTRING may be followed by one colon to indicate it
     has a required argument, and by two colons to indicate it has an
     optional argument.

     Each subsequent invocation of 'getopt' processes next command line
     argument.  'Getopt' returns true if the argument is an option and
     returns false otherwise.  It stores the retrieved option (always
     with a leading dash) in the variable OPT ('OPTVAR' by default).  If
     the option has an argument, the latter is stored in the variable
     ARG ('OPTARG' by default).  Index of the next command line argument
     to be processed is preserved in the variable IND ('OPTIND' by
     default).

     The usual way of processing command line options is by invoking
     'getopt' in a condition expression of 'while' loop and analyzing
     its return values within the loop.  For example:

          while getopt "hf:"
          case $OPTVAR in
          "-h")  print "Got -h option\n"
          "-f")  print "Got -f option. Argument is " $OPTARG "\n"
          ".*")  begin
                    print "Unknown option: " $OPTVAR "\n"
                    exit 1
                 end
            end
          end

 -- Radtest statement: input [EXPR NAME]
     Evaluates EXPR and prints its result on standard output.  Then
     reads a line from standard input and assigns it to the variable
     NAME.

     If EXPR is given, NAME must also be present.

     If NAME is not given, variable INPUT is used by default.

 -- Radtest statement: set OPTIONS
     Sets 'radtest' command line options.  OPTIONS should be a valid
     'radtest' command line (*note Invoking radtest::).

 -- Radtest statement: shift [EXPR]
     Shift positional parameters left by one, so that '$2' becomes '$1',
     '$3' becomes '$2' etc.  '$#' is decremented.  '$0' is not affected.

     If EXPR is given, it is evaluated, converted to integer and used as
     shift value.  Thus 'shift 2' shifts all positional parameters left
     by 2.

 -- Radtest statement: return [EXPR]
     Returns from the current function (*note Function Definitions::).
     If EXPR is present, it is evaluated and the value thus obtained
     becomes the function return value.

     It is an error to use 'return' outside of a function definition.

 -- Radtest statement: break [N]
     Exit from within a loop.If N is specified, break from NUMBER
     levels.  N must be >= 1.  If N is greater than the number of
     enclosing loops, an error message is issued.

     *Note Loops::, for the detailed discussion of the subject.

 -- Radtest statement: continue [N]
     Resume the next iteration of the enclosing loop.  If N is
     specified, resume at the Nth enclosing loop.  N must be >= 1.  If N
     is greater than the number of enclosing loops, an error message is
     issued.

     *Note Loops::, for the detailed discussion of the subject.

 -- Radtest statement: exit [EXPR]
     Exit to the shell.  If EXPR is specified, it is evaluated and used
     as exit code.  Otherwise, 0 is returned to the shell.

 -- Radtest statement: print EXPR-LIST
     Evaluate and print expressions.  EXPR-LIST is whitespace or
     comma-separated list of expressions.  Each expression is evaluated
     in turn and printed to the standard output.

 -- Radtest statement: send [FLAGS] PORT-TYPE CODE EXPR-OR-PAIR-LIST
     Send a request to the RADIUS server and wait for the reply.  Stores
     reply code in the variable 'REPLY_CODE' and reply A/V pairs in the
     variable 'REPLY' (*note Interacting with Radius Servers::).

     FLAGS are a whitespace-separated list of variable assignments.
     Following variables are understood:

     'repeat=N'
          Unconditionally resend the request N times.

     'id=N'
          Specify the request ID.

     'keepauth=1'
          Do not alter request authenticator when re-sending the
          request.

     PORT-TYPE
          Specifies which port to use when sending the request.  Use
          'auth' to send the request to the authentication port (*note
          auth-port: clientconf.), and 'acct' to send it to the
          accounting port (*note acct-port: clientconf.).

     CODE
          RADIUS request code.  Either numeric or symbolic (*note
          Numeric Values::).

     EXPR-OR-PAIR-LIST
          Specifies the A/V pairs to include in the request.  This
          argument is either an expression evaluating to 'avlist', or an
          immediate 'avlist' (*note Avlists::).  In the latter case, the
          parentheses around the list are optional.

 -- Radtest statement: expect CODE [EXPR-OR-PAIR-LIST]
     Test if 'REPLY_CODE' matches CODE and, optionally, if 'REPLY'
     matches EXPR-OR-PAIR-LIST.  If so, print the string 'PASS',
     otherwise print 'FAIL'.

     *Note Interacting with Radius Servers::, for the detailed
     discussion of this statement.


File: radius.info,  Node: Sample Radtest Program,  Prev: Built-in Primitives,  Up: radtest

12.2.12 Sample Radtest Program
------------------------------

As an example, let's consider 'radauth' program (*note Radauth::).  Its
main purpose is to send authentication request to the remote server,
analyze its reply and if it is positive, send an appropriate accounting
record, thereby initiating user's session.  Optionally, the script
should also be able to send a lone accounting record.

   In the discussion below, we will show and explain subsequent parts of
the script text.  For the ease of explanation, each line of program text
will be prepended by its ordinal line number.

Parsing command line options
----------------------------

The script begins as follows:

       1 #! /usr/bin/radtest -f
       2
       3 while getopt "n:s:P:hv"
       4 begin
       5   case $OPTVAR in
       6   "-n") NASIP = $OPTARG
       7   "-s") SID = $OPTARG
       8   "-P") PID = $OPTARG
       9   "-v") set -v

1
     It is a "pragmatic comment" informing shell that it should run
     'radtest' in order to interpret the program.

3
     This line starts option processing loop.  'Getopt' (*note getopt:
     Built-in Primitives.) in line 3 analyzes each subsequent command
     line argument and if it is an option checks whether it matches one
     of the option letters defined in its first argument.  The option
     letter will be returned in 'OPTVAR' variable, its argument (if any)
     - in 'OPTARG' variable.

4 - 8
     'OPTARG' value is analyzed using 'case' statement.  Lines 6 - 8
     preserve 'OPTARG' values in appropriate variables for later use.
     'NASIP' will be used as the value of 'NAS-IP-Address' attribute,
     'SID' is the session id ('Acct-Session-Id' attribute), and 'PID' is
     the port number (for 'NAS-Port-Id' attribute.

9
     This line sets '-v' option to the 'radtest' interpreter (*note
     Invoking radtest::).

The next piece of code handles '-h' and erroneous options:

      10   "-h") begin
      11           print <<-EOT
      12            usage: radauth [OPTIONS] [COMMAND] login [password]
      13            Options are:
      14            -v         Print verbose descriptions of what is being done
      15            -n IP      Set NAS IP address
      16            -s SID     Set session ID
      17            -P PORT    Set NAS port number
      18            COMMAND is one of:
      19            auth       Send only Access-Request (default)
      20            acct       Send Access-Request. If successfull, send
      21                       accounting start request
      22            start      Send accounting start request
      23            stop       Send accounting stop request
      24            EOT
      25           exit 0
      26         end
      27   ".*") begin
      28           print "Unknown option: " $OPTVAR "\n"
      29           exit 1
      30         end
      31   end
      32 end

10 - 26
     Print short description and exit, if the program is given '-h'.
     Notice that 'here document' syntax is used to print the text (*Note
     Strings::, for its description).  The leading whitespace in lines
     12 to 24 is composed of tabulation characters (ASCII 9), not usual
     space characters (ASCII 32), as required by '<<-' construct.

27 - 30
     These lines handle unrecognized options.

31
     Closes case statement started on line 5

32
     Closes compound statement started on line 4

Checking Command Line Consistency
---------------------------------

      33
      34 shift ${OPTIND}-1
      35
      36 if $# > 3
      37 begin
      38         print "Wrong number of arguments."
      39         print "Try radauth -h for more info"
      40         exit 1
      41 end

34
     'OPTIND' keeps the ordinal number of the first non-optional
     argument.  This line shifts off all the options processed by
     'getopt', so that the first non-optional argument may be addressed
     by '$1' notation.  Notice use of curly braces to solve "minus
     ambiguity" (*note minus-ambiguity::).

36 - 41
     At this point we may have at most three arguments: command, user
     name, and password.  If there are more, display the diagnostic
     message and exit the program.

Next piece of code:

      42
      43 case $1 in
      44 "auth|acct|start|stop") begin
      45                           COMMAND=$1
      46                           shift 1
      47                         end
      48 ".*")   COMMAND="auth"
      49 end
      50
      51 LOGIN=${1:?User name is not specified. Try radauth -h for more info.}
      52
      53 if ${NASIP:-} = ""
      54         NASIP=$SOURCEIP
      55
      56 LIST = ( User-Name = $LOGIN NAS-IP-Address = $NASIP )

43 - 48
     Check if a command is given.  If so, store command name in the
     variable 'COMMAND' and shift arguments by one, so login becomes
     argument '$1'.  Otherwise, assume 'auth' command.

51
     If the user login name is supplied, store it into 'LOGIN' variable.
     Otherwise, print diagnostic message and exit.

53 - 54
     Provide a default value for 'NASIP' variable from the built-in
     variable 'SOURCEIP' (*note Built-in Variables::)

56
     The variable 'LIST' will hold the list of A/V pairs to be sent to
     the server.  This line initializes it with a list of two A/V pairs:
     'User-Name' and 'NAS-IP-Address'.

Defining Accounting Function
----------------------------

Accounting function will be used to send accounting requests to the
server.  It is supposed to take a single argument: an 'avlist' of A/V
pairs to be sent to the server.

      57
      58 'acct'
      59 begin
      60   if ${SID:-} = ""
      61     input "Enter session ID: " SID
      62   if ${PID:-} = ""
      63     input "Enter NAS port ID: " PID
      64   send acct Accounting-Request $1 + \
                 (Acct-Session-Id = $SID NAS-Port-Id = $PID)

58 - 59
     These lines start the function definition.  Notice quoting of the
     function name ('acct'): it is necessary because it coincides with a
     reserved keyword (*note Reserved Keywords::).

60 - 61
     If the value of 'SID' (session ID) is not supplied, prompt the user
     to input it.

62 - 63
     If the value of 'PID' (port ID) is not supplied, prompt the user to
     input it.

64
     Send accounting request.  The list of A/V pairs to send is formed
     by concatenating 'Acct-Session-Id' and 'NAS-Port-Id' attributes to
     the function's first argument.

The final part of 'acct' function analyzes the reply from the server:

      65   if $REPLY_CODE != Accounting-Response
      66   begin
      67     print "Accounting failed.\n"
      68     exit 1
      69   end
      70   print "Accounting OK.\n"
      71   exit 0
      72 end
      73

Notice, that 'acct' never returns.  Instead it exits with an error code
indicating success or failure.

Defining Authentication Function
--------------------------------

The purpose of the authentication function 'auth' is to send an
'Access-Request' to the server and perform some actions based on its
reply.

   The function will take three arguments:

'$1'
     The list of A/V pairs to include in the request.

'$2'
     User password.

'$3'
     This argument indicates whether accounting request must be sent
     after successful authentication.  String 'yes' means to send the
     accounting request, 'no' means not to send it.

   The function is not expected to return.  Instead it should exit to
the shell with an appropriate error code.

      74 'auth'
      75 begin
      76   send auth Access-Request $1 + (User-Password = $2)

74 - 75
     Begin the function definition.  Notice quoting of the function name
     ('auth'): it is necessary because it coincides with a reserved
     keyword (*note Reserved Keywords::).

76
     Send the initial authentication request.  The list of A/V pairs is
     formed by appending 'User-Password' pair to the list given by the
     first argument to the function.

The rest of the function analyzes the reply from the server and takes
appropriate actions.  Notice that if the server replies with an
'Access-Challenge' packet, we will have to send subsequent
authentication requests, so this piece of code is enclosed within a
'while' loop.

   First, the function handles 'Access-Accept' and 'Access-Reject'
replies:

      77   while 1
      78   begin
      79     if $REPLY_CODE = Access-Accept
      80     begin
      81       print "Authentication passed. " + $REPLY[Reply-Message*] + "\n"
      82       if ${3:-no} = no
      83         exit 0
      84       'acct'($1 + ( Acct-Status-Type = Start ))
      85     end else if $REPLY_CODE = Access-Reject
      86     begin
      87       print "Authentication failed. " + $REPLY[Reply-Message*] + "\n"
      88       break

77
     Begin an "endless" 'while' loop.  It will eventually be exited
     either using 'break', or using 'exit' (see below).

79 - 84
     Handle 'Access-Accept' replies:

81
     Print the reply message.  Notice the use of '*' to print all the
     instances of 'Reply-Message' attribute from the reply packet (*note
     Accessing Elements of A/V Pair Lists::).

82 - 83
     If the third argument is missing or is a string 'no', exit
     indicating success (*note Dereferencing Variables::).

84
     Otherwise, call 'acct' function to perform accounting.  The A/V
     pairs included in the accounting request are formed by adding
     'Acct-Status-Type' attribute to the list given by the first
     argument to the function.

85 - 88
     Handle 'Access-Reject' replies.  Print the reply message and break
     from the loop.

Next piece of code deals with 'Access-Challenge' replies.  For
simplicity we assume that such replies always carry user menus (*Note
menus directory::, for the description of these).  So, upon receiving an
'Access-Challenge' we should print out the menu, read the users
selection and send back an 'Access-Request' to the server.  This part is
the only one that actually continues the loop at line 77.

      89     end else if $REPLY_CODE = Access-Challenge
      90     begin
      91       print $REPLY[Reply-Message*]
      92       input
      93       send auth Access-Request \
      94         (User-Name = $LOGIN User-Password = $INPUT \
                  State = $REPLY[State])

91
     Print the menu contents carried by 'Reply-Message' attributes.
     There may be several instances of the attribute, hence the use of
     '*' to concatenate their values together.

92
     Read the input from the user.  The input will be stored in 'INPUT'
     variable.  *Note Built-in Primitives::, for the description of
     'input' statement.

93 - 94
     Send an 'Access-Request' packet with three attributes.
     'User-Password' contains the user reply, 'State' contains the menu
     state from the server reply packet.

Final part of the function:

      95     end else begin
      96       print "Authentication failed. Reply code " + $REPLY_CODE + "\n"
      97       break
      98     end
      99   end
     100   exit 1
     101 end
     102

95 - 98
     Handle unknown reply codes.

99
     Closes the while loop started on line 77.

100
     Exit to the shell indicating failure.  This statement will be
     reached only if a 'break' is executed either on line 88 or on line
     97.

101
     Closes function definition started on lines 74 - 75

Final Part of Radauth Program
-----------------------------

The final part selects an action based on the user command and executes
it.  It is equivalent to the 'main' function in a 'C' program:

     103 case ${COMMAND} in
     104 "auth")   'auth'($LIST, ${2:&Password: }, no)
     105 "acct")   'auth'($LIST, ${2:&Password: }, yes)
     106 "start")  'acct'($LIST+(Acct-Status-Type = Start))
     107 "stop")   'acct'($LIST+(Acct-Status-Type = Stop))
     108 ".*")       begin
     109               print "Unknown command. Try radauth -h for more info"
     110               exit 1
     111             end
     112 end
     113
     114 # End of radauth

103
     Select an action based on the value of 'COMMAND' variable.

104 - 105
     Call 'auth' function.  If the second argument is given in the
     command line, its value is taken as user's password.  Otherwise,
     the user is prompted for the password with the string 'Password: '.
     The input is read with echo turned off to prevent the password from
     being compromised (the ':&' construct, *note Dereferencing

12.4 'nas.scm'
==============

'nas.scm' is a Guile program that allows one to convert a GNU/Linux box
into a NAS.  It requires Guile version 1.4 or better and PPP version
2.3.7 or better.

   To use it, you will basically need to do the following:

  1. Create links:

          ln -s LIBEXEC/nas.scm /etc/ppp/ip-up
          ln -s LIBEXEC/nas.scm /etc/ppp/ip-down

     Here, LIBEXEC denotes the location of your libexec directory, where
     'nas.scm' is installed.  If not overridden at configure time, it
     defaults to 'PREFIX/libexec'.  These links assure that 'ppp' will
     invoke 'nas.scm' when the user's session starts and ends, thus
     giving it a possibility to send accounting requests.
  2. Configure the file 'raddb/client.conf'.
  3. Edit the file 'raddb/nas.rc'.  The supplied 'nas.rc' template is
     tailored to work in most environments.  The only variables you may
     need to change are 'nas-log-facility', specifying the syslog
     facility to be used for logging, and 'pppd-args', keeping the
     arguments to be given to 'ppp'.
  4. Configure your '/etc/inittab' and 'getty'.

     For example, if you use 'mgetty', then the 'inittab' entries for
     dial-up lines will look like:

          d0:345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty ttyS0 vt100
          d1:345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty ttyS1 vt100
          ...

     'mgetty''s 'login.config' will then contain the following line:

          *       -       -       /usr/local/libexec/nas.scm @

     If you use 'agetty', then the 'inittab' will contain (with the long
     lines split for readability)

          d0:345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -mt60 \
             -l /usr/local/libexec/nas.scm 38400,19200,9600 \
             ttyS0 vt100
          d1:345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -mt60 \
             -l /usr/local/libexec/nas.scm 38400,19200,9600 \
             ttyS1 vt100
          ...

12.5 'pam_radius.so'
====================

'pam_radius.so' is a PAM module for Radius authentication.  The module
understands the following command line options:

'audit'
     Enable audit information.

'debug[=LEVEL]'
     Enable debugging information.  The higher LEVEL is, the more
     debugging info is output.  When omitted, LEVEL defaults to 100.

     Debugging levels equal to or greater than 10 compromise users'
     passwords, so use them sparingly.

'use_authtok'
     Use the authentication token passed from the previous module in the
     stack.

'confdir=PATH'
     Look for configuration files in PATH.  The default is
     '$sysconfdir/etc/raddb'.

'attr:'
     This keyword marks the end of command line options.  The part of
     the command line after it is parsed as a whitespace-separated list
     of A/V pairs to be sent with the request.

'service_type=TYPE'
     This option is retained for compatibility with the 0.96 series of
     GNU Radius.  It is equivalent to

                  attr: Service-Type=TYPE

   The 'pam_radius.so' module logs its messages under 'LOG_AUTH' syslog
facility.

13 Attribute List
*****************

The following sections describe the most frequently used Radius
attributes.  Each attribute is described as follows:

     ATTRIBUTE NAME VALUE TYPE
        Users:                    'USER-FLAGS'
        Hints:                    'HINTS-FLAGS'
        Huntgroups:               'HUNTGROUP-FLAGS'
        Additivity:               ADDITIVITY
        Proxy propagated:         PROP

   These values have the following meaning:

NAME
     The attribute name.
VALUE
     The attribute number.
TYPE
     The attribute type.
USER-FLAGS
     Syntax flags defining in which part of a 'raddb/users' entry this
     attribute may be used.  The flags consist of two letters: 'L' means
     the attribute can be used in the LHS, 'R' means it can be used in
     the RHS.
HINTS-FLAGS
     Syntax flags defining in which part of a 'raddb/hints' entry this
     attribute may be used.
HUNTGROUP-FLAGS
     Syntax flags defining in which part of a 'raddb/huntgroups' entry
     this attribute may be used.
ADDITIVITY
     The "additivity" of the attribute determines what happens if a rule
     attempts to add to the pair list an attribute that is already
     present in this list.  Depending on its value, the actions of the
     server are:
     Append
          New attribute is appended to the end of the list.
     Replace
          New attribute replaces the old.
     Drop
          New attribute is dropped.  The old one remains in the list.
PROP
     Is the attribute propagated back to the NAS if the server works in
     proxy mode?

   The entry N/A for any of this fields signifies "not applicable".

        Proxy propagated:         No

   This attribute indicates the address to be configured for the user.
It may be used in Access-Accept packets.  It may be used in an
Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the server that it would
prefer that address, but the server is not required to honor the hint.

   The value '0xFFFFFFFF' ('255.255.255.255') indicates that the NAS
should allow the user to select an address.  The value '0xFFFFFFFE'
('255.255.255.254') indicates that the NAS should select an address for
the user (e.g.  assigned from a pool of addresses kept by the NAS).
Other valid values indicate that the NAS should use that value as the
user's IP.

   When used in a RHS, the value of this attribute can optionally be
followed by a plus sign.  This usage means that the value of
'NAS-Port-Id' must be added to this IP before replying.  For example,

             Framed-IP-Address = 10.10.0.1+

   This attribute indicates the physical port number of the NAS that is
authenticating the user.  It is only used in Access-Request packets.
Note that here we are using "port" in its sense of a physical connection
on the NAS, not in the sense of a TCP or UDP port number.

   Some NASes try to encode various information in the 'NAS-Port-Id'
attribute value.  For example, the MAX Ascend terminal server constructs
'NAS-Port-Id' by concatenating the line type (one digit), the line
number (two digits), and the channel number (two digits), thus producing
a five-digit port number.  In order to normalize such encoded port
numbers we recommend using a rewrite function (*note rewrite file::).  A
rewrite function for MAX Ascend servers is provided in the distribution.

     VALUE      Service-Type      Call-Check           10

   This attribute indicates the type of service the user has requested,
or the type of service to be provided.  It may be used in both
Access-Request and Access-Accept packets.

   When used in an Access-Request the service type represents a hint to
the Radius server that the NAS has reason to believe the user would
prefer the kind of service indicated.

   When used in an Access-Accept, the service type is an indication to
the NAS that the user must be provided this type of service.

   The meaning of various service types is as follows:

'Login-User'
     The user should be connected to a host.

'Framed-User'
     A framed protocol, such as PPP or SLIP, should be started for the
     user.  The 'Framed-IP-Address' attribute (*note
     Framed-IP-Address::) will supply the IP to be used.

'Callback-Login-User'
     The user should be disconnected and called back, then connected to
     a host.

'Callback-Framed-User'
     The user should be disconnected and called back; then a framed
     protocol, such as PPP or SLIP, should be started for the user.

'Outbound-User'
     The user should be granted access to outgoing devices.

'Administrative-User'
     The user should be granted access to the administrative interface
     to the NAS, from which privileged commands can be executed.

'NAS-Prompt'
     The user should be provided a command prompt on the NAS, from which
     nonprivileged commands can be executed.

'Authenticate-Only'
     Only authentication is requested, and no authorization information
     needs to be returned in the Access-Accept.

'Call-Check'
'Callback-NAS-Prompt'
     The user should be disconnected and called back, then provided a
     command prompt on the NAS, from which nonprivileged commands can be
     executed.

   This attribute is available to be sent by the server to the client in
an Access-Challenge and *must* be sent unmodified from the client to the
server in the new Access-Request reply to that challenge, if any.

   This attribute is available to be sent by the server to the client in
an Access-Accept that also includes a 'Termination-Action' attribute
with the value 'RADIUS-Request'.  If the NAS performs the termination
action by sending a new Access-Request upon termination of the current
session, it *must* include the 'State' attribute unchanged in that
Access-Request.

   In either usage, no interpretation by the client should be made.  A
packet may have only one 'State' attribute.

   This attribute indicates the name of the user to be authenticated or
accounted.  It is used in Access-Request and Accounting attributes.  The
length of the user name is usually limited by some arbitrary value.  By
default, Radius supports user names up to 32 characters long.  This
value can be modified by redefining the 'RUT_USERNAME' macro in the
'include/radutmp.h' file in the distribution directory and recompiling
the program.

   Some NASes have peculiarities about sending long user names.  For
example, the Specialix Jetstream 8500 24-port access server inserts a
'/' character after the 10th character if the user name is longer than
10 characters.  In such cases, we recommend applying rewrite functions
in order to bring the user name to its normal form (*note rewrite
file::).

        Proxy propagated:         No

   This attribute indicates the password of the user to be
authenticated, or the user's input following an Access-Challenge.  It is
only used in Access-Request packets.

   On transmission, the password is hidden.  The password is first
padded at the end with nulls to a multiple of 16 octets.  A one-way MD5
hash is calculated over a stream of octets consisting of the shared
secret followed by the request authenticator.  This value is XORed with
the first 16 octet segment of the password and placed in the first 16
octets of the String field of the User-Password attribute.

   If the password is longer than 16 characters, a second one-way MD5
hash is calculated over a stream of octets consisting of the shared
secret followed by the result of the first xor.  That hash is XORed with
the second 16 octet segment of the password and placed in the second 16
octets of the string field of the User-Password attribute.

   If necessary, this operation is repeated, with each XOR result being
used along with the shared secret to generate the next hash to XOR the
next segment of the password, up to no more than 128 characters.

        Proxy propagated:         N/A

   The 'Acct-Ext-Program' attribute can be used in RHS of an
'raddb/hints' to require the execution of an external accounting program
or filter.  If the attribute value starts with a vertical bar ('|'),
then the attribute specifies the filter program to be used.  If it
starts with a slash ('/'), then it is understood as the full pathname
and arguments for the external program to be executed.  Using any other
character as the start of this string results in error.

   The command line can reference any attributes from both check and
reply pairlists using attribute macros (*note Macro Substitution::).

   Before the execution of the program, 'radiusd' switches to the uid
and gid of the user 'daemon' and the group 'daemon'.  You can override
these defaults by setting variables 'exec-program-user' and
'exec-program-group' in configuration file to proper values (*note The
option statement: option.).

   The accounting program must exit with status 0 to indicate a
successful accounting.

13.3.3 'Auth-Failure-Trigger'
-----------------------------

This attribute specifies an external program or a Scheme expression to
be run upon an authentication failure.  The handling of this attribute
depends upon its value:

   If the value of 'Auth-Failure-Trigger' begins with '/', it is taken
to contain a command line for invoking an external program.  In this
case 'radiusd' invokes the program much the same way it does when
handling 'Exec-Program' attribute, i.e.  the program is invoked with
standard input closed, its standard output and standard error are
captured and redirected to 'RADLOG/radius.stderr' file, the return value
of the program is ignored.

   If the value of 'Auth-Failure-Trigger' begins with '(', it is
executed it as a 'Scheme' expression.  The return value of the
expression is ignored.

   This attribute is designed as a means to provide special handling for
authentication failures.  It can be used, for example, to increase
failure counters and to block accounts after a specified number of
authentication failures occurs.  *Note Auth Probing::, for the detailed
discussion of its usage.

   The 'Auth-Data' can be used to pass additional data to the
authentication methods that need them.  In version 1.7 of GNU Radius,
this attribute may be used in conjunction with the 'SQL' and 'Pam'
authentication types.  When used with the 'Pam' authentication type,
this attribute holds the name of the PAM service to use.  This attribute
is temporarily appended to the authentication request, so its value can
be referenced to as '%C{Auth-Data}'.  *Note Authentication Server

     VALUE      Auth-Type         Accept               254

   This attribute tells the server which type of authentication to apply
to a particular user.  It can be used in the LHS of the user's profile
(*note Authentication::.)

   Radius interprets values of 'Auth-Type' attribute as follows:

'Local'
     The value of the 'User-Password' attribute from the record is taken
     as a cleantext password and is compared against the 'User-Password'
     value from the input packet.

'System'
     This means that a user's password is stored in a system password
     type.  Radius queries the operating system to determine if the user
     name and password supplied in the incoming packet are O.K.

'Crypt-Local'
     The value of the 'User-Password' attribute from the record is taken
     as an MD5 hash on the user's password.  Radius generates MD5 hash
     on the supplied 'User-Password' value and compares the two strings.

'Reject'
     Authentication fails.

'Accept'
     Authentication succeeds.

'SQL'
'Mysql'
     The MD5-encrypted user's password is queried from the SQL database
     (*note SQL Auth::).  'Mysql' is an alias maintained for
     compatibility with other versions of Radius.

'Pam'
     The user-name-password combination is checked using PAM.

13.3.7.1 Running an External Program
....................................

The command line can reference any attributes from both check and reply
pairlists using attribute macros *note Macro Substitution::.

   Before the execution of the program, 'radiusd' switches to uid and
gid of the user 'daemon' and the group 'daemon'.  You can override these
defaults by setting the variable 'exec-program-user' in the
configuration file to a proper value.  *Note The option statement:
option.

   The daemon will wait until the program terminates.  The return value
of its execution determines whether the entry matches.  If the program
exits with a nonzero code, then the match fails.  If it exits with a
zero code, the match succeeds.  In this case the standard output of the
program is read and parsed as if it were a pairlist.  The attributes
thus obtained are added to the entry's reply attributes.

Example.
--------

Suppose the 'users' file contains the following entry:

     DEFAULT Auth-Type = System,
                     Simultaneous-Use = 1
             Exec-Program-Wait = "/usr/local/sbin/telauth \
                                  %C{User-Name} \
                                  %C{Calling-Station-Id}"

Then, upon successful matching, the program '/usr/local/sbin/telauth'
will be executed.  It will get as its arguments the values of the
'User-Name' and 'Calling-Station-Id' attributes from the request pairs.

   The '/usr/local/sbin/telauth' can, for example, contain the
following:

     #! /bin/sh

     DB=/var/db/userlist

     if grep "$1:$2" $DB; then
         echo "Service-Type = Login,"
         echo "Session-Timeout = 1200"
         exit 0
     else
         echo "Reply-Message = \
               \"You are not authorized to log in\""
         exit 1
     fi

It is assumed that '/var/db/userlist' contains a list of
'username':'caller-id' pairs for those users that are authorized to use
login service.


File: radius.info,  Node: Using External Filter,  Prev: Running External Program,  Up: Exec-Program-Wait

13.3.7.2 Using an External Filter
.................................

If the value of 'Exec-Program-Wait' attribute begins with '|', 'radiusd'
strips this character from the value and uses the resulting string as a
name of the predefined external filter.  Such filter must be declared in
'raddb/config' (*note filters::).

Example.
--------

Let the 'users' file contain the following entry:

     DEFAULT Auth-Type = System,
                     Simultaneous-Use = 1
             Exec-Program-Wait = "|myfilter"

and let the 'raddb/config' contain the following (1):

     filters {
         filter myfilter {
             exec-path "/usr/libexec/myfilter";
             error-log "myfilter.log";
             auth {
                 input-format "%C{User-Name}
                               %C{Calling-Station-Id}";
                 wait-reply yes;
             };
         };
     };
Then, upon successful authentication, the program
'/usr/libexec/myfilter' will be invoked, if it hasn't already been
started for this thread.  Any output it sends to its standard error will
be redirected to the file 'myfilter.log' in the current logging
directory.  A string consisting of the user's login name and his calling
station ID followed by a newline will be sent to the program.

   The following is a sample '/usr/libexec/myfilter' written in the
shell:

     #! /bin/sh

     DB=/var/db/userlist

     while read NAME CLID
     do
         if grep "$1:$2" $DB; then
             echo "0 Service-Type = Login, Session-Timeout = 1200"
         else
             echo "1 Reply-Message = \
                   \"You are not authorized to log in\""
         fi
     done

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In this example the 'input-format' statement has been split on
two lines to fit the page width.  It must occupy a _single line_ in the
real configuration file.

   When present in the RHS, the 'Exec-Program' attribute specifies the
full pathname and arguments for the program to be executed when the
entry matches.

   The command line can reference any attributes from both check and
reply pairlists, using attribute macros (*note Macro Substitution::).

   Before the execution of the program, 'radiusd' switches to the uid
and gid of the user 'daemon' and the group 'daemon'.  You can override
these defaults by setting variables 'exec-program-user' and
'exec-program-group' in configuration file to proper values *note The
option statement: option.

   The daemon does not wait for the process to terminate.

Example
-------

Suppose the 'users' file contains the following entry:

     DEFAULT Auth-Type = System,
                     Simultaneous-Use = 1
             Exec-Program = "/usr/local/sbin/logauth \

                             %C{Calling-Station-Id}"

Then, upon successful matching, the program '/usr/local/sbin/logauth'
will be executed.  It will get as its arguments the values of the
'User-Name' and 'Calling-Station-Id' attributes from the request pairs.

     VALUE      Fall-Through      Yes                  1

   The 'Fall-Through' attribute should be used in the reply list.  If
its value is set to 'Yes' in a particular record, that tells Radius to
continue looking up other records even when the record at hand matches
the request.  It can be used to provide default values for several
profiles.

   Consider the following example.  Let's suppose the 'users' file
contains the following:


     johns   Auth-Type = SQL
                     Framed-IP-Address = 11.10.10.251,
                     Fall-Through = Yes

     smith   Auth-Type = SQL
                     Framed-IP-Address = 11.10.10.252,
                     Fall-Through = Yes

     DEFAULT NAS-IP-Address = 11.10.10.1
             Service-Type = Framed-User,
                     Framed-Protocol = PPP


Then after successful matching of a particular user's record, the
matching will continue until it finds the 'DEFAULT' entry, which will
add its RHS to the reply pairs for this request.  The effect is that, if
user 'johns' authenticates successfully she gets the following reply
pairs:

             Service-Type = Framed-User,
             Framed-Protocol = PPP,
             Framed-IP-Address = 11.10.10.251

whereas user 'smith' gets

             Service-Type = Framed-User,
             Framed-Protocol = PPP,
             Framed-IP-Address = 11.10.10.252

Note that the attribute 'Fall-Through' itself is never returned to the
NAS.

   Use the 'Hint' attribute to specify additional matching criteria
depending on the hint (*note hints file::).

   Let the 'hints' file contain

     DEFAULT         Prefix = "S", Strip-User-Name = No
                     Hint = "SLIP"

and the 'users' file contain

             Service-Type = Framed-User,
                     Framed-Protocol = SLIP


   Then any user having a valid system account and coming from NAS
'11.10.10.12' will be provided SLIP service if his user name starts with
'S'.

   The 'Huntgroup-Name' can be used either in the LHS of the 'users'
file record or in the RHS of the 'huntgroups' file record.

   When encountered in a LHS of a particular 'users' profile, this
attribute indicates the huntgroup name to be matched.  Radius looks up
the corresponding record in the 'huntgroups' file.  If such a record is
found, each A/V pair from its reply list is compared against the
corresponding pair from the request being processed.  The request
matches only if it contains all the attributes from the specified
huntgroup, and their values satisfy the conditions listed in the
huntgroup pairs.

   For example, suppose that the authentication request contains the
following attributes:

     User-Name = "john",
     User-Password = "guess",
     NAS-IP-Address = 10.11.11.1,
     NAS-Port-Id = 24

Let us further suppose that the 'users' file contains the following
entry:

     john    Huntgroup-Name = "users_group",
                     Auth-Type = System
             Service-Type = Login

and, finally, 'huntgroups' contains the following entry:

     users_group     NAS-IP-Address = 10.11.11.1
                     NAS-Port-Id < 32

Then the authentication request will succeed, since it contains
'NAS-Port-Id' attribute and its value is less than 32.

     Do not show the password with the log message from a successful
     authentication.
'Log-Failed-Pass'
     Do not show a failed password.
'Log-Pass'
     Do not show a plaintext password, either failed or succeeded.
'Log-All'
     Do not log authentications at all.

   Technical details: After authentication, the server collects all
'Log-Mode-Mask' attributes from the incoming request and LHS of the
user's entry.  The values of these attributes ORed together form a mask,
which is applied via an XOR operation to the current log mode.  The
value thus obtained is used as effective log mode.

13.3.14 'Login-Time'
--------------------

     ATTRIBUTE Login-Time 1042 string
        Users:                    'L-'
        Hints:                    '--'
        Huntgroups:               '--'
        Additivity:               Append
        Proxy propagated:         No

   The 'Login-Time' attribute specifies the time range over which the
user is allowed to log in.  The attribute should be specified in the
LHS.

   The format of the 'Login-Time' string is the same as that of UUCP
time ranges.  The following description of the time range format is
adopted from the documentation for the Taylor UUCP package:

   A time string may be a list of simple time strings separated with
vertical bars '|' or commas ','.

   Each simple time string must begin either with a day-of-week
abbreviation (one of 'Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa'), or 'Wk'
for any day from Monday to Friday inclusive, or 'Any' or 'Al' for any
day.

   Following the day may be a range of hours separated with a hyphen,
using 24-hour time.  The range of hours may cross 0; for example
'2300-0700' means any time except 7 AM to 11 PM. If no time is given,
calls may be made at any time on the specified day(s).

   The time string may also be the single word 'Never', which does not
match any time.

   Here are a few sample time strings with an explanation of what they
mean.

'Wk2305-0855,Sa,Su2305-1655'

     This means weekdays before 8:55 AM or after 11:05 PM, any time
     Saturday, or Sunday before 4:55 PM or after 11:05 PM. These are
     approximately the times during which night rates apply to phone
     calls in the U.S.A. Note that this time string uses, for example,
     '2305' rather than '2300'; this will ensure a cheap rate even if
     the computer clock is running up to five minutes ahead of the real
     time.

'Wk0905-2255,Su1705-2255'

     This means weekdays from 9:05 AM to 10:55 PM, or Sunday from 5:05
     PM to 10:55 PM. This is approximately the opposite of the previous
     example.

'Any'

     This means any day.  Since no time is specified, it means any time
     on any day.

13.3.15 'Match-Profile'
-----------------------

     ATTRIBUTE Match-Profile 2004 string
        Users:                    'LR'
        Hints:                    '-R'
        Huntgroups:               '-R'
        Additivity:               Append
        Proxy propagated:         No

   The 'Match-Profile' attribute can be used in LHS and RHS lists of a
user profile.  Its value is the name of another user's profile (target
profile).  When 'Match-Profile' is used in the LHS, the incoming packet
will match this profile only if it matches the target profile.  In this
case the reply pairs will be formed by concatenating the RHS lists from
both profiles.  When used in the RHS, this attribute causes the reply
pairs from the target profile to be appended to the reply from the
current profile if the target profile matches the incoming request.

   For example:

     IPPOOL  NAS-IP-Address = 10.10.10.1
                     Framed-Protocol = PPP,
                     Framed-IP-Address = "10.10.10.2"

     IPPOOL  NAS-IP-Address = 10.10.11.1
                     Framed-Protocol = PPP,
                     Framed-IP-Address = "10.10.11.2"

     guest   Auth-Type = SQL
                     Service-Type = Framed-User,
             Match-Profile = IPPOOL

   In this example, when user 'guest' comes from NAS '10.10.10.1', he is
assigned IP '10.10.10.2', otherwise if he is coming from NAS
'10.10.11.1' he is assigned IP '10.10.11.2'.

   This attribute should be used in the RHS.  If it is used, it should
be the only reply item.

   The 'Menu' attribute specifies the name of the menu to be presented
to the user.  The corresponding menu code is looked up in the
'RADIUS_DIR/menus/' directory (*note menus directory::).

        Proxy propagated:         No

   The 'Pam-Auth' attribute can be used in conjunction with

     Auth-Type = Pam

to supply the PAM service name instead of the default 'radius'.  It is
ignored if 'Auth-Type' attribute is not set to 'Pam'.

        Additivity:               Append
        Proxy propagated:         No

   The 'Prefix' attribute indicates the prefix that the user name should
contain in order for a particular record in the profile to be matched.
This attribute should be specified in the LHS of the 'users' or 'hints'
file.

   For example, if the 'users' file contained

     DEFAULT Prefix = "U", Auth-Type = System
                     Service-Type = Login-User

then the user names 'Ugray' and 'Uyoda' would match this record, whereas
'gray' and 'yoda' would not.

   Both 'Prefix' and 'Suffix' attributes may be specified in a profile.
In this case the record is matched only if the user name contains both
the prefix and the suffix specified.

   Use this attribute to modify the user name from the incoming packet.
The 'Replace-User-Name' can reference any attributes from both LHS and
RHS pairlists using attribute macros (*note Macro Substitution::).

   For example, the 'users' entry

     guest   NAS-IP-Address = 11.10.10.11,
                     Calling-Station-Id != ""
                     Auth-Type = Accept

                     Service-Type = Framed-User,
                     Framed-Protocol = PPP

allows the use of PPP service for user name 'guest', coming from NAS
'11.10.10.11' with a nonempty 'Calling-Station-Id' attribute.  A string
consisting of a '#' character followed by the 'Calling-Station-Id' value
is appended to the user name.

     VALUE      Strip-User-Name   Yes                  1

   The value of 'Strip-User-Name' indicates whether Radius should strip
any prefixes/suffixes specified in the user's profile from the user
name.  When it is set to 'Yes', the user names will be logged and
accounted without any prefixes or suffixes.

   A user may have several user names for different kind of services.
In this case differentiating the user names by their prefixes and
stripping them off before accounting would help keep accounting records
consistent.

   For example, let's suppose the 'users' file contains

     DEFAULT Suffix = ".ppp",
                     Strip-User-Name = Yes,
                     Auth-Type = SQL
             Service-Type = Framed-User,
                     Framed-Protocol = PPP

     DEFAULT Suffix = ".slip",
                     Strip-User-Name = Yes,
                     Auth-Type = SQL
             Service-Type = Framed-User,
                     Framed-Protocol = SLIP

Now, user 'johns', having a valid account in the SQL database, logs in
as 'johns.ppp'.  She then is provided the PPP service, and her PPP
session is accounted under user name 'johns'.  Later on, she logs in as
'johns.slip'.  In this case she is provided the SLIP service and again
her session is accounted under her real user name 'johns'.

        Additivity:               Append
        Proxy propagated:         No

   The 'Suffix' attribute indicates the suffix that the user name should
contain in order for a particular record in the profile to be matched.
This attribute should be specified in LHS of the 'users' or 'hints'
file.

   For example, if the 'users' file contained

     DEFAULT Suffix = ".ppp", Auth-Type = System,
                     Strip-User-Name = Yes
             Service-Type = Framed-User,
                     Framed-Protocol = PPP

then the user names 'gray.ppp' and 'yoda.ppp' would match this record,
whereas 'gray' and 'yoda' would not.

   Both 'Prefix' and 'Suffix' attributes may be specified in a profile.
In this case the record is matched only if the user name contains both
the prefix and the suffix specified.

Radius Glossary
***************

Throughout this document the following terms are used:

RADIUS (small capitals)
     The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service protocol as
     described in RFC 2138, 2865, and 2866.

NAS
     A network access server, that is, a computer or a special device
     designed to provide access to the network.  For example, it can be
     a computer connected to the network and equipped with several
     modems.  Such a NAS will allow a user connecting to one of its
     modems to access the network.

Service
     A service, such as PPP, SLIP, or telnet, provided to a user by the
     NAS.

Session
     Each instance of a service.  Sessions start when the service is
     first provided and close when the service is ended.  A user may be
     allowed to have multiple sessions active simultaneously.

Session ID
     The session identifier: a string of characters uniquely identifying
     the session.

A/V pair
     Attribute-value pair: see *note Attributes::.

Dial-in or dial-up user
     A user connecting to a service through the modem line.

User database
     A database where a RADIUS server keeps information about users,
     their authentication information, etc.

User's profile
     A record in the user database describing a particular user for
     purposes of authentication and authorization, i.e., how the user
     should be authenticated as well as which services he is allowed to
     be provided and parameters of these services.

A.1 A brief description of Currently Used Approach
==================================================

When I started to write GNU Radius, back in 1998, I had two major aims.
The first and primary aim was to create a flexible and robust system
that would follow the principle of Jon Postel:

     Be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you send.

   This, I believe, is the main principle of any good software for
Internet.

   The second aim was to be backward compatible with the implementations
that already existed back then.  This seemed to be important (and the
time has proved it was), because it would allow users to easily switch
from older radius daemon to GNU Radius.

   An important part of every complex program is its configuration file.
Traditional implementations of RADIUS servers (beginning from Livingston
Radius) used a configuration suite consisting of several files, usually
located in '/etc/raddb' subdirectory.  Its main components were:

'dictionary'
     A file containing translations of symbolic names of radius
     attributes and attribute values to their integer numbers as
     specified by RADIUS protocol.

'hints'
     This file was intended to separate incoming requests in groups,
     based on the form of their login name.  Traditionally such
     separation was performed basing on common "prefixes" and/or
     "suffixes" of login names.

'huntgroups'
     The purpose of this file was to separate incoming requests
     depending on their source, i.e.  on the NAS that sent them and the
     port number on that NAS.  It also served as a sort of simplified
     "access control list".

'users'
     This file contained a users database.  It described criteria for
     authentication and "reply pairs" to be sent back to requesting
     NASes.

   Among these files, the first two were used for requests of any kind,
whereas 'users' was used only for 'Access-Request' packets.

   Though this configuration system suffered from many inconsistencies,
the "second aim" required GNU Radius to use this approach.

   To compensate for its deficiencies and to fulfill the "first aim",
this configuration system was extended, while preserving its main
functionality.  A number of additional "internal attributes" were added,
that control 'radiusd' behavior.  A new language was created whose main
purpose was to modify incoming requests (*note Rewrite::).  The support
for "GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions" (*note
Guile::) was added, that allowed to further extend GNU Radius
functionality.

   The present operation model(1) of GNU Radius and its configuration
file system(2) emerged as a result of the two development aims described
above.  Since 1998 up to present, GNU Radius users contributed a lot of
ideas and code to the further development of the system.

   However, it became obvious that this system presents strong obstacles
to the further development.  The next section addresses its
deficiencies.

   (1) *Note Operation::.

   (2) *Note Configuration Files::.


File: radius.info,  Node: Deficiencies,  Next: Solution,  Prev: Present State,  Up: GNU configuration

A.2 Deficiencies of Current Operation Model and Configuration Suite
===================================================================

The main deficiencies are inherited with the traditional configuration
file suite.  The rules for processing each request are split among three
files, each of which is processed differently, despite of their external
similarity.  The administrator has to keep in mind a set of exotic rules
when configuring the system(1).  When matching incoming requests with
configuration file entries ("LHS", *note Matching Rule::), some
attributes are taken verbatim, whereas others are used to control
'radiusd' behavior and to pass additional data to other rules (*note
Radius Internal Attributes::).  The things become even more complicated
when RADIUS realms come into play (*note Proxy Service::).  Some
attributes are meaningful only if used in a certain part of a certain
configuration file rule.

   So, while being a lot more flexible than the approach used by other
RADIUS implementations, the current system is quite difficult to
maintain.

   Another deficiency is little control over actions executed on
different events.  For example, it is often asked how can one block a
user account after a predefined number of authentication failures?
Currently this can only be done by writing an external authentication
procedure (either in Scheme, using Guile, or as a standalone executable,
using 'Exec-Program-Wait').  The proper solution would be to have a set
of user-defined triggers for every RADIUS event (in this case, for
authentication failure).

   Another commonly asked question is how to make 'radiusd' execute
several SQL queries when processing a request.  While GNU Radius is not
supposed to compensate for deficiencies of some SQL implementations that
do not allow for nested queries, such a feature could come quite handy.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) 'Hints' is processed for each request...  Authentication requests
first pass 'hints', then 'huntgroups', then 'users'...  Accounting
requests use only 'hints' and 'huntgroups'...  'Huntgroups' entries may
also be used (sometimes inadvertently) to create ACL rules, etc, etc...

A.3 Proposed Solution
=====================

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

   Processing of incoming requests is controlled by "request-processing
program".  Request-processing program is a list-like structure,
consisting of "instructions".

* Menu:

* Instruction::
* grad_instr_conditional::
* grad_instr_call::
* grad_instr_return::
* grad_instr_action::
* grad_instr_reply::
* grad_instr_proxy::
* grad_instr_forward::


File: radius.info,  Node: Instruction,  Next: grad_instr_conditional,  Up: Solution

A.3.1 Request-processing Instruction
------------------------------------

"Request-processing program" consists of "instructions".  There are
seven basic instruction types:

'grad_instr_conditional_t'
     This instruction marks a branch point within the program.

'grad_instr_call_t'
     Represents a "call" of a subprogram

'grad_instr_action_t'
     Invokes a Rewrite function

'grad_instr_proxy_t'
     Proxies a request to the remote server

'grad_instr_forward_t'
     Forwards a request to the remote server

'grad_instr_reply_t'
     Replies back to the requesting NAS.

   Consequently, an instruction is defined as a union of the above node
types:

 -- Instruction: grad_instr_t
          enum grad_instr_type
          {
            grad_instr_conditional,
            grad_instr_call,
            grad_instr_return,
            grad_instr_action,
            grad_instr_reply,
            grad_instr_proxy,
            grad_instr_forward
          };

          typedef struct grad_instr grad_instr_t;

          struct grad_instr
          {
            enum grad_instr_type type;
            grad_instr_t *next;
            union
              {
                grad_instr_conditional_t cond;
                grad_instr_call_t call;
                grad_instr_action_t action;
                grad_instr_reply_t reply;
                grad_instr_proxy_t proxy;
                grad_instr_forward_t forward;
              } v;
          };

     'Type' member contains type of the instruction.  The evaluator uses
     'type' to determine which part of 'union v', holds
     instruction-specific data.

     'Next' points to the next instruction.  The evaluator will go to
     this instruction unless the present one changes the control flow.

     Finally, 'v' contains instruction-specific data.  These will be
     discussed in the following subsections.


File: radius.info,  Node: grad_instr_conditional,  Next: grad_instr_call,  Prev: Instruction,  Up: Solution

A.3.2 grad_instr_conditional
----------------------------

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

 -- Instruction: grad_instr_conditional_t cond iftrue iffalse
          struct grad_instr_conditional
          {
            grad_entry_point_t cond;  /* Entry point to the compiled
                                         Rewrite condition */
            grad_instr_t *iftrue;     /* Points to the ``true'' branch  */
            grad_instr_t *iffalse;    /* Points to the ``false'' branch  */
          };
          typedef struct grad_instr_conditional grad_instr_conditional_t;

     Instructions of type 'grad_instr_conditional_t' indicate branching.
     Upon encountering an 'grad_instr_conditional_t', the engine
     executes a Rewrite expression pointed to by 'cond'.  If the
     expression evaluates to 'true', execution branches to instruction
     'iftrue'.  Otherwise, if 'iffalse' is not 'NULL', execution
     branches to that instruction.  Otherwise, the control flow passes
     to 'grad_instr_t.next', as described in the previous section.

RPL representation
------------------

 -- RPL defun: COND EXPR IF-TRUE [IF-FALSE]

     EXPR
          Textual representation of Rewrite conditional expression or
          its entry point.
     IF-TRUE
          RPL expression executed if EXPR evaluates to 't'.
     IF-TRUE
          Optional RPL expression that is executed if EXPR evaluates to
          'nil'.

Example
-------

'COND' with two arguments:

     (COND "%[User-Name] ~= \"test-.*\""
           (REPLY Access-Reject ("Reply-Message" . "Test accounts disabled")))

'COND' with three arguments:

     (COND "%[Hint] == "PPP" && authorize(PAM)"
           (REPLY Access-Accept
                  ("Service-Type" . "Framed-User")
                  ("Framed-Protocol" . "PPP"))
           (REPLY Access-Reject
                  ("Reply-Message" . "Access Denied")))

A.3.3 grad_instr_call
---------------------

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

 -- Instruction: grad_instr_call_t entry
          struct grad_instr_call {
                 grad_instr_t *entry;
          };
          typedef struct grad_instr_call grad_instr_call_t;

   Instructions of type 'grad_instr_call' instruct the engine to "call"
the given subprogram.  The engine pushes the current instruction to the
return point stack and branches to instruction 'entry'.  Execution of
the subprogram ends when the engine encounters an instruction of one of
the following types: 'grad_instr_return', 'grad_instr_reply' or
'grad_instr_proxy'.

   If 'grad_instr_return' is encountered, the engine pops the
instruction from the top of the return point stack and makes it current
instruction, then it branches to the 'next' node.

   If 'grad_instr_reply' or 'grad_instr_proxy' is encountered, the
engine, after executing corresponding actions, finishes executing the
program.

RPL representation
------------------

 -- RPL defun: CALL LIST
 -- RPL defun: CALL DEFUN-NAME
     In the first form, the argument LIST is the RPL subprogram to be
     executed.

     In the second form DEFUN-NAME is a name of the RPL subprogram
     defined by 'defun'.

Examples
--------

First form:

     (CALL (ACTION "myfun(%[User-Name])")
           (REPLY Access-Reject
                  ("Reply-Message" . "Access Denied")))

Second form:

     (CALL process_users)

A.3.4 grad_instr_return
-----------------------

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

   An instruction of type 'grad_instr_return' indicates a return point
from the subprogram.  If encountered in a subprogram (i.e.  a program
entered by 'grad_instr_call' node), it indicates return to the calling
subprogram (see the previous subsection).  Otherwise, if
'grad_instr_return' is encountered within the main trunk, it ends
evaluating of the program.

   Instructions of this type have no data associated with them in union
'v'.

RPL representation
------------------

 -- RPL defun: RETURN

Examples
--------

     (RETURN)


File: radius.info,  Node: grad_instr_action,  Next: grad_instr_reply,  Prev: grad_instr_return,  Up: Solution

A.3.5 grad_instr_action
-----------------------

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

 -- Instruction: grad_instr_reply_t expr
          struct grad_instr_action {
                 grad_entry_point_t expr;    /* Entry point to the compiled
                                                Rewrite expression */
          };
          typedef struct grad_instr_action grad_instr_reply_t;

   The machine executes a Rewrite expression with entry point 'expr'.
Any return value from the expression is ignored.

RPL representation
------------------

 -- RPL defun: ACTION EXPR
 -- RPL defun: ACTION ENTRY-POINT

Examples
--------

     (ACTION "%[NAS-IP-Address] = request_source_ip()")


File: radius.info,  Node: grad_instr_reply,  Next: grad_instr_proxy,  Prev: grad_instr_action,  Up: Solution

A.3.6 grad_instr_reply
----------------------

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

 -- Instruction: grad_instr_reply_t return_code
          struct grad_instr_reply {
                 u_char reply_code;         /* Radius request code */
          };
          typedef struct grad_instr_reply grad_instr_reply_t;

   'grad_instr_reply' instructs 'radiusd' to send to the requesting NAS
a reply with code 'reply_code'.  Any reply pairs collected while
executing the program are attached to the reply.

   After executing 'grad_instr_reply' instruction, the engine stops
executing of the program.

   Any execution path will usually end with this instruction.

RPL representation
------------------

 -- RPL defun: REPLY REPLY-CODE [ATTR-LIST]

     Arguments:
     REPLY-CODE
          Radius reply code.
     ATTR-LIST
          List of A/V pairs to be added to the reply.  Each A/V pair is
          represented as a 'cons': '(NAME-OR-NUMBER . VALUE)'.

Example
-------

     (REPLY Access-Accept
            ("Service-Type" . "Framed-User")
            ("Framed-Protocol" . "PPP"))


File: radius.info,  Node: grad_instr_proxy,  Next: grad_instr_forward,  Prev: grad_instr_reply,  Up: Solution

A.3.7 grad_instr_proxy
----------------------

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

 -- Instruction: grad_instr_proxy_t realm
          struct grad_instr_proxy
          {
            grad_realm_t realm;
          };
          typedef struct grad_instr_proxy grad_instr_proxy_t;

   This instruction tells radius to proxy the request to the server
defined in 'realm'.  In other words, the engine executes 'proxy_send'.
Further processing of the program is stopped.

RPL representation
------------------

 -- RPL defun: PROXY REALM-NAME
     REALM-NAME is name of the realm as defined in 'raddb/realms'.

Examples
--------

.

A.3.8 grad_instr_forward
------------------------

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

 -- Instruction: grad_instr_forward_t server_list
          struct grad_instr_forward
          {
            grad_list_t server_list;
          };
          typedef struct grad_instr_forward grad_instr_forward_t;

   This node "forwards" the request to each servers from 'server_list'.
Forwarding differs from proxying in that the requests are sent to the
remote servers _and_ processed locally.  The remote server is not
expected to reply.  *Note forwarding: auth, for more information on this
subject.

   In contrast to 'grad_instr_proxy', this instruction type does not
cause the execution to stop.

   Elements of 'server_list' are of type 'grad_server_t'.

   Currently forwarding is performed by 'forward_request' function
('forward.c'), which could be used with little modifications.  Namely,
it will be rewritten to get server list as argument, instead of using
static variable 'forward_list'.  Consequently, the functions responsible
for creating and initializing this static variable will disappear along
with the variable itself.  .

A.5 Support for Traditional Configuration Files.
================================================

     _(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)_

   Within the new configuration system, the traditional "trio"
'hints-huntgroups-users' will be translated to the following program:

     (defprog main
      (CALL hints)
      (CALL huntgroups)
      (COND "request_code() == Access-Request"
            (CALL users))
      (REPLY Access-Reject
             (Reply-Message . "\nAccess denied\n")))

   For example, consider the following configuration:

     # raddb/hints:
     DEFAULT Prefix = "PPP" Hint = PPP

   This will produce the following program:

     (defprog hints
      (COND "%[Prefix] == \"PPP\"")
            (ACTION "%[Hint] = \"PPP\""))

     #raddb/huntgroups
     DEFAULT NAS-IP-Address = 10.10.4.1      Suffix = "staff"
     DEFAULT NAS-IP-Address = 10.10.4.2      Huntgroup-Name = "second"

   Will produce

     (defprog huntgroups
      (COND "%[NAS-IP-Address] == 10.10.4.1 && !(%[Suffix] == \"staff\")"
            (REPLY Access-Reject
                   ("Reply-Message" . "Access Denied by Huntgroup")))
      (COND "%[NAS-IP-Address] == 10.10.4.2"
            (ACTION "%[Huntgroup-Name] = \"second\"")))

   Finally, 'users':

     #raddb/users
     DEFAULT Hint = "PPP",
                    Auth-Type = PAM
             Service-Type = Framed-User,
                    Framed-Protocol = PPP

     DEFAULT Huntgroup-Name = "second",
                    Auth-Type = PAM
             Service-Type = "Authenticate-Only",
                    Reply-Message = "Authentity Confirmed"

will produce

     (defprog users
      (COND "%[Hint] == "PPP" && authorize(PAM)"
            (REPLY Access-Accept
                  (Service-Type . Framed-User)
                  (Framed-Protocol . PPP))
            (REPLY Access-Reject
                  (Reply-Message . "Access Denied")))
      (COND "%[Huntgroup-Name] == \"second\" && authorize(PAM)"
            (REPLY Access-Accept
                   (Service-Type . "Authenticate-Only")
                   (Reply-Message . "Authentity Confirmed"))))

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
