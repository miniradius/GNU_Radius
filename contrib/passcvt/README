This file documents `passcvt' program. See end of file for
copying conditions.

* Introduction

`Passcvt' reads information from the system passwd database (i.e.
/etc/group, /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files) and converts it to
a series of SQL statements that can be used to populate RADIUS
database. The primary use of this script is to facilitate switching
from Auth-Type=System to Auth-Type=SQL.

Notice, that `passcvt' works only for systems with usual shadow password
suite. If you are running FreeBSD or similar system, see ../passwd_to_db.

* Operation

Each run of `passcvt' creates following files:

 sql		An SQL script that can be directly fed to mysql to
		populate the database with the users' data
 password.new	A password file, containing all the users that did not
	        get to `sql'.
 shadow.new	A shadow file, containing all the users that did not
	        get to `sql'.
 shadow.only    This file contains all records from the original
                `shadow' file that did not have their counterparts in `passwd'.

All these files are created in the directory specified by --outdir
command line option, or in the current working directory if this option
was not given.

The simplest way to use `passcvt' is to run it without arguments. In this
case it will create only `sql' file (and, eventually `shadow.only' if 
shadow file contained some hung records). Notice that `sql' file will
contain information about all users on the system, even `root'!

The more realistic example is when you wish to put into the database only
those users that belong to a certain group or groups. Such groups may be
specified using --group option. For example, to move users from groups
101 and 102 into SQL, you may run:

 passcvt --group 101,102

Then, examine the output files. If everything is OK, feed `sql' to `mysql'
and replace your `/etc/passwd' and `/etc/shadow' with `passwd.new' and
`shadow.new':

$ passcvt --group 101,102
$ ls
password.new shadow.new sql
$ # Examine output files!!!
$ mysql -uUSER -pPASS RADIUS < sql
$ cp passwd.new /etc/passwd
$ cp shadow.new /etc/shadow

* Options

`Passcvt' accepts the following options (defaults are given in brackets):

   -g, --group GROUP-LIST      Select only users from given groups.
                               GROUP-LIST is a comma-separated list of
                               group names or IDs.
   -s, --service STRING        Set service name [Framed-PPP]
   -o, --outdir DIR            Set output directory name [.]
   --sysconfdir DIR            Override the name of the system configuration
                               directory [/etc]
   --help                      Print the short help summary

* Caveats

** Do not use passcvt on FreeBSD and similar systems. Use passwd_to_db
instead (see contrib/passwd_to_db).
** You have to be root to access /etc/shadow
** For security reasons, all output files are created with permissions 0600
** Carefully examine passwd.new and shadow.new before copying them to
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.
** Pay special attention to shadow.only file. Its presense indicates that
your /etc/passwd was not in sync with /etc/shadow.
