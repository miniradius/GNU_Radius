	The WEB-RADACT interface.


  This is a web interface to GNU Radius accounting database. It
  displays the entries from MySQL database selected by the range
  of date/time of call and possibly a user name. The entries can
  be sorted by any field either in ascending or in descending
  order.

  1. Requirements
  ===============

  The system where you install WEB-RADACT should be running an
  http server. It should have perl interpreter at least version
  5.005 with DBI and Mysql perl modules installed.

  2. Installation
  ===============

  To install WEB-RADACT, you first need to create in your radius
  database a table containing title strings for the MySQL columns
  you wish to see listed. The table should be named `call_title'.
  The sample call_title tables are available in files call_table.en
  and call_table.es. These are constructed to be used with the call
  table structure desrcibed in the distributed raddb/sqlserver file.
  You can create a table by specifying in your command line:

	  mysql [OPTIONS] DBNAME < call_table.es

  where OPTIONS are any optional arguments needed at your site and
  DBNAME is the database name you have selected for your radius database.

  Copy radact.cgi file to your cgi-bin directory and edit variables
  $mysql_login, $mysql_pass, $mysql_table and  $mysql_dsn to suit
  your needs. The file should have executable permissions set.

  Copy file radius.css to your DocumentRoot directory.

  3. Customization
  =================

  The number and order of fields to display can be specified by simply
  editing table call_title. The fields are displayed in the order they
  appear in this table.
  Currently WEB-RADACT supports two languages: Spanish and English.
  It can be easily configured to any other language: all you need to do
  is to store translated column names in column `title' of the table
  `call_title' and change variables @mesesNom (radact.cgi:60) and
  %lang (radact.cgi:66) to contain strings in your native language.  
  When you add some columns to your radius accounting table and wish
  them to appear in the WEB-RADACT be sure to add appropriate records
  to `call_title' table.
