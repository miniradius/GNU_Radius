I make the recommendation quite regularly to use a mysql database instead
of the system password file. I finished cleaning up my perl script to suck
in a FreeBSD password file into a mysql database.

mysqldump:

http://kod.inch.com/radius/users.sql

perl script:

http://kod.inch.com/radius/passwd_to_db.pl

Anyone familiar with DBI can translate that in to all of the databases
that DBI supports, and I tried to leave it pretty easy to customize it to
different OS's shadow password file, but I was scratching my own itch so
it just does FreeBSD at the moment.

If you want to put those in contrib you are welcome to, and I'm always
looking for suggestions for improvement. It could probably use a little
more error checking in some parts, but I've looked at it enough for today.

The next time I have to suck a users file into a database again I'll send
you a link to the script I write to do that as well.

Gerald
