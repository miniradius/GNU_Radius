TODO for GNU Radius

* Redesign configuration files. The goals are:
** get rid of the mess in raddb, replacing it with a single 
logically structured configuration file.
** restructure the packet matching logic (from hints,huntgroups,users)
to allow for writing more complicated and logically structured rules.
Possibly this will allow to get rid from the so-called 'server
attributes', this will make dictionary simpler and clearer.
** The current configuration file system should be supported as well.

* Consider replacing obsolete usage of AC_CHECK_TYPE in configure.ac

* libgnuradius
** Finish normalizing the namespace. 

* Guile interface
** Make server queue a usual Guile object (possibly a SMOB) instead of a
hidden list.
** Remove calls to grad_path_init and grad_dict_init from radscm_init to a
separate function

* The server:
** Support rfc2433.txt  rfc2548.txt  rfc2759.txt
** Support for LDAP
** Add \ line continuation to read_raddb_files.
** Scheme-Program and Scheme-Acct-Program must be able to accept arbitrary
s-exps as well as function names
** Move GNU attributes into a separate namespace. This will require
registering a vendor id...
** Clean up the semantics of log_init/log_done.
** Enable use of port number in rewrite:check_unix()?
** Add include feature to config files that don't have it.
** Revise the possibility of listing memory and queue usage via
snmp.
** Add missing SNMP MIBS and check the compliance of the snmpserv.c
to RFC 2619,2621
** SNMP should reflect each NAS that has actually sent requests to radiusd
instead of the listing the configured NASes. The current behavior
becomes wrong with the introduction of CIDR notation in raddb/naslist.
** Move the radtest functionality to the test shell and remove radtest
altogether?

* Redesign raduse to use snmp queries instead of peeking in radstat.
* Write radctl substitute which would use SNMP.
