# This file emulates the functionality of GNU Radius versions prior
# to 1.0, which used to skip accounting for Sync port types and
# for administrative account "!root". If you wish to continue
# using this functionality, add the following two lines to the
# beginning of your raddb/config:

DEFAULT	NAS-Port-Type = Sync
	Acct-Type = None,
		Fall-Through = Yes

"!root"	NULL
	Acct-Type = None,
		Fall-Through = Yes
