* Introduction

This file contains brief information about configuring, testing
and running GNU Radius. It is *not* intended as a replacement
for the documentation, it is provided as a brief reference only.
The complete documentation for GNU Radius is available in
doc/texinfo subdirectory. To read it without installing the package
run `info -f doc/texinfo/radius'. After the package is installed
the documentation can be accessed running `info radius'.

The online copy of the documentation in various formats is available
at http://www.gnu.org/software/radius/manual.

* Installation

If you are upgrading from a previous version of GNU Radius, make
sure to read the section `Upgrading from earlier versions' below.

To install the package, do:

** ./configure [options]

For the list of available options consult file INSTALL.
The applications-specific options are:
			      			      	
*** --disable-debug
	Disable debugging functions. This results in slightly more compact
    	code, but makes configuration issues difficult to debug. Use at
    	your own risk.

*** --with-auth-port=NUMBER
	Specify port number to use for authentication. Default is 1812.
        The default port number for accounting is computed as auth_port + 1.

*** --enable-pam
    	Enable PAM support.
	
*** --enable-dbm[={dbm|ndbm}]
	Enable dbm support. If no argument is specified, usual DBM is
	assumed. The `ndbm' argument instructs to enable support of NDBM.
		
*** --with-mysql
	Enable MySQL support. Usually this requires setting
	appropriate values for LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS variables.
    
*** --with-postgres
	Enable PostgreSQL support. Usually this requires setting
	appropriate values for LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS variables.

*** --with-odbc[={odbc|iodbc}]
        Configure to work with ODBC. This is an experimental feature, it
        has not been tested thoroughly.
    
*** --without-guile
	Do not compile Guile support. By default, Guile support is
	enabled if guile 2.2 or later is installed on the system. Use
	this option if you don't need it.

*** --without-server-guile
	Do not compile server Guile support

*** --enable-client
	Build client programs: pam_radius module (if PAM is
	configured), and NAS emulator nas.scm (if Guile is
	enabled).

*** --disable-server
        Do not build radius server. This implies --enable-client.
	
*** --with-readline
	Enable GNU readline support for radiusd test shell mode.

*** --without-readline
	Disable GNU readline support

*** --enable-snmp[=compat]
	Enable SNMP support. By default this enables the use of enterprise
        subtree .iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises.gnu.radius
        (.1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.1). To enable support for the subtree used
        in previous versions of radius (i.e.
        .iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises.gnu-radius =
        .1.3.6.1.4.1.9163) use --enable-snmp=compat form of this
        option.
        
*** --enable-livingston-menus
        Enable support for Livingston-compatible menus.

*** --enable-deny-shell=SHELL
	Always reject users with the given shell.

*** --with-pamdir=DIR
	Install PAM modules in the given DIR. Default is
    	$prefix/lib/security.

*** --with-log-dir=DIRNAME
	Specifies the full pathname to the default logging directory.
	By default it is either /var/log or /usr/adm, whichever is
	applicable to your operationg system and directory layout.
	
*** --with-pid-dir=DIRNAME
	Specifies the full pathname to the directory where radiusd
	will store its pid-file (radiusd.pid). Default is either
	"/var/run", or, if this directory does not exist,
	"$sysconfdir/raddb".

** Run make.

The GNU make is preferred.

** Check it.

You can check the functionality of the package without installing
it. To do so, run

        make check

** Run `make install'

* Creating SQL database.

If you have configured Radius with SQL support, you may wish
to create the authentication and accounting database. Notice,
that if you already have a running database, you may continue
using it with GNU Radius. You will only have to modify file
raddb/sqlserver to match your database structure.

To create a fresh Radius database, follow the procedure below:

** Change to the subdirectory db/

** Edit file config.m4.

Most of its contents is commented out, so uncomment anything that may
be needed. Variables are: 
    
    server   - SQL server name or IP address
    port     - port to connect to

	User credentials for creator of the database:
    
    CREATOR  - SQL username. This user must have create privileges.
    CREATOR_PASSWORD - SQL password.

	User credentials for the owner of the database:
    
    DB_USER  - SQL username.
    DB_PWD   - SQL password.
    (These must coincide with the values in raddb/sqlserver file)
    
** Run `make mysql' or `make pgsql'

(depending on the type of SQL server you are using.)

To get the database structure without creating it, run
`make mysql.struct' or `make pgsql.struct'.
    
* Upgrading from earlier versions of GNU Radius

Please, read file NEWS. It contains important information
about upgrading from earlier versions, as well as an
exhaustive list of all the new features.
               
* Configuring

the mailing archives on the same page, as they might already
contain the answer.
        
* Testing.		

The commands described below use the configuration file
raddb/client.conf. See the documentation for the detailed description
of this file. The default raddb/client.conf installed from the distribution
should suffice to test the server in default configuration.

** Using radauth
    
Use radauth to send various radius requests to the running
server. The invocation syntax is:

            radauth [OPTIONS] [COMMAND] username [pass]

OPTIONS are:
    -v          Print verbose descriptions of what is being done
    -n IP	Set NAS IP address
    -s SID      Set session ID
    -P PORT     Set NAS port number
COMMAND is one of:
    auth        Send only Access-Request (default)
    acct        Send Access-Request. If successfull, send
                accounting start request
    start       Send accounting start request
    stop 	Send accounting stop request

So, to test authentication, run:

  radauth LOGIN PASSWD 

You may omit PASSWD if you wish to prevent the password from being
compromised. In this case, radauth will disable echoing on the screen,
prompt you for the password, and turn the echoing on again.

To test accounting, use

  radauth -s SID -P PORT start LOGIN
or
  radauth -s SID -P PORT stop LOGIN  

Options may be omitted. Radauth will prompt you for the value of
any missing option, e.g.:

$ radauth start gray
Enter session ID: a001
Enter NAS port ID: 1

To fully simulate actions of a NAS when initiating user session, use
acct command:

  radauth -s SID -P PORT acct LOGIN PASSWD  

Again, you may omit options as well as PASSWD.

** Using radsession
    
If you have guile version 2.2 or newer installed, you can use
radsession script to send authentication/accounting requests
to the server. 

*** Authentication test

  radsession -l LOGIN -p PASSWD -P PORT-ID --auth

*** Accounting test

To test accounting do:

  radsession -l LOGIN -p PASSWD -P PORT-ID -s SESSION-ID --start
or
  radsession -l LOGIN -P PORT-ID -s SESSION-ID --stop

Where:
	LOGIN		is the user's login name
	PASSWD		is his password. Use `.' (dot) to get prompted
			for the password as passwd(1) does.
	PORT-ID		is the port number
	SESSION-ID	is a session ID (a string uniquely identifying
			the session). It can be an arbitrary string
			when used with --start option. It should be
			a session ID of a previously started session
			when used with --stop option.

** Examples using radauth and radsession

The examples below assume that you have your radius server up and
running, your user database contains a record for user `hamlet' with
password `guessme'. The examples show two alternative variants of testing
commands: using radauth command and using radsession. 

To authenticate `hamlet' and start a radius session, invoke:

     radauth -P 1 -s 0001 acct hamlet guessme
or
     radsession -l hamlet -p guessme -P 1 -s 0001 --start

Now, if you run radwho, you will get something like:

     Login             Name What  TTY     When     From        Location
hamlet           hamlet      PPP  S001  Mon 07:22 localhost    255.255.255.254

whereas radlast will show the following;

hamlet      local    001 127.0.0.2       Thu Mon 07 07:22 - still logged in

radwtmp begins Fri Dec 01 16:36:59 2000

Then, suppose you run:

        radauth -P 1 -s 0001 stop hamlet
or	
	radsession -l hamlet -P 1 -s 0001 --stop

This will send a stop record for session 0001. Radlast will then show
something like:

hamlet      local    001 127.0.0.2       Thu Mon 07 07:22 - 07:25  (00:03) 

radwtmp begins Fri Dec 01 16:36:59 2000

** Using radtest

Radtest is a radius client shell providing simple yet powerful
scripting language and allowing to send arbitrary radius requests
and analize server replies. It allows you to write sophisticated
procedures for interacting with the remote servers. In particular,
it may come handy when testing some non-standard configurations.

See accompanying documentation (chapter "Radtest") for the detailed
description of the tool.
